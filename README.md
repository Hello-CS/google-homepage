# google-homepage

This is the Foundation project for The Odin Project - Google Homepage.

I will be creating a clone of the Google homepage in this repository displaying
a set number of skills as listed below.

1. HTML formatting
2. CSS formatting
3. Size Adjustments via CSS
4. Form Creations
5. Flexbox Usage
6. Image Imports and Adjustments
7. Usage of SVG images (Mainly imitated)

This has been a relatively terrible page that is not perfect. Code is also extremely messy and not efficient.
